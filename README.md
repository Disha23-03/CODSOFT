# CODSOFT
This repository contains the first 3 out of 5 Python-based projects completed as part of my CodSoft Internship. Each project focuses on applying core Python concepts to real-world problems through command-line applications.

ðŸ“Œ Project 1: To-Do List (Command-Line Application)
A simple task manager that allows users to:

Add tasks

View current tasks

Mark tasks as done (and remove them)

All through an interactive menu system.

ðŸ“Œ Project 2: Calculator (Command-Line Application)
A basic calculator that performs:

Addition

Subtraction

Multiplication

Division

Users select an operation and provide two numbers. Includes error handling for invalid input and division by zero.

ðŸ“Œ Project 3: Password Generator
A secure password generator that:

Asks the user for desired password length

Generates a password using random letters, numbers, and symbols

Uses Pythonâ€™s random and string modules for character selection



These projects were developed as part of the CodSoft Internship, aimed at applying Python programming skills in small-scale applications.
